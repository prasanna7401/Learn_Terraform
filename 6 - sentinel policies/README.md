You can either have the sentinel policy sets in your code base, or directly in your Terraform cloud workspace/ organization policy settings.

- If you want to run using CLI, then form a CLI/API connection first.
- Else, if your code is stored in a VCS (github.com), then form a connection to the repository from Policy settings.
