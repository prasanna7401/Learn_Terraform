**Recommendations**:

- One module - One function - One task - One lifecycle
- Always do version pinning (mention a specific version)
- Pass important module parameters as outputs to improve reusability
- Use appropriate prefix/suffix
- Along with `modules/` folder, create an `sample_code/` folder with codes for testing and reference purposes.
- Use `validation{}` blocks to validate use input.
- use `external` data source to execute some script and fetch any data and use that data in terraform.
