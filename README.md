# Learn Terraform
Contains terraform scripts used for learning the Terraform Associate exam.

## Topics:



5. Terraform Cloud - Features and test config run screenshots. Contains `backend` code blocks
6. [Sentinel](./6%20-%20sentinel%20policies/) - Policy as a code (ex. enfore tagging resources, restrict public storage accounts, etc.)
7. [Packer](./7%20-%20packer/) - VM Image builder tool: can use config management tools like Shell, Ansible, Chef, etc. alongside. Also contains `lifecycle`, `terraform import` examples to build an apache http server
8. Vault - Terraform Secret Server deployment process and usage in code.

## Useful items:

1. **State BACKUP**: 
    - If stored _**locally**_, the `tfstate.backup` file contains the previous terraform apply results. 
    - if storing in a _**remote backend**_, make sure to enable versioning to be able to roll back..


2. **[IMPORT Real-world resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import)**:
  _2.1. How to import a resource configuration for managing via terraform_
   - Step-1: Create an empty resource block in the terraform file 
    ```hcl
        resource "aws_security_group" "to_be_imported" {
        # fill later after import
        }
    ```
    - Step-2: Run `terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <resource_id>` (For example, aws_security_group.example sg-12345)
    - Step-3: After the configurations get imported into your state file, run `terraform show` or `terraform state show <resource_type>.<resource_name>`
    - Step-4: Clean up the output-only attributes like `id`, `arn`, `timestamp`, etc. and add the code block the terraform configuration file.

> Other options: For bulk import of resources, you can use tools like `terraformer` & `terracognita`

3. **Avoid Resource modification/deletion (useful for imported/critical resources)**:
    - Option-1: Add a lifecycle block to your code:
        ```hcl
        lifecycle {
            ignore_changes = [cidr_block] # or any specific resource config
            prevent_destroy = true
        }
        ```
    - Option-2: Manually remove the resource configuration from the state file.
        ```sh
            terraform state rm aws_instance.example
        ```

4. **[Schematize/Validate Input variables:](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/)** Use `validation` block
   ```hcl
        variable "public_ip" { 
        description = "Public IP address for the service" 
        type = string 
        validation { 
            condition = can(regex("^(([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3})$", var.public_ip)) && length(split(".", var.public_ip)) == 4 && alltrue([for octet in split(".", var.public_ip) : tonumber(octet) <= 255]) 
            error_message = "The Public IP address must be in the format x.x.x.x where x is a number between 0 and 255." 
            } 
        }

   ```

6. **Isolating environments** (based on environments and resource lifecycle): An example for AWS Infrastructure is shown below

- Splitting components into separate folders avoids the risk of destroying your entire infrastructure with one command but complicates creating your entire infrastructure at once. With a single Terraform configuration, you can spin up everything with one terraform apply command. With components in separate folders, you must run terraform apply in each folder individually. The solution: use Terragrunt's `run-all` command to execute commands across multiple folders concurrently.
- Breaking the code into multiple folders complicates using resource dependencies. If your app and database code were in the same Terraform configuration files, the app could directly access database attributes (e.g., `aws_db_instance.foo.address`). In separate folders, this direct access isnâ€™t possible. The solution: use `dependency {}`blocks in Terragrunt.

7. **Enforce Default Tags**: You can set up default tags during the provider configuration.
    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
        region = "something"
        default_tags {
            tags = {
                deployment = "terraform"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
